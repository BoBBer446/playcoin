3DSx Play Coin Setter
========

Allows Ninjhax users to modify the 3DS's play coin counter, in other words providing infinite play coins. No more than 300 can be held at a time, this is a system limit.

Note that this code is simply a modification of yellows8's [3ds_homemenu_extdatatool](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_homemenu_extdatatool), which includes within it code to modify arbitrary 3ds extdata.
